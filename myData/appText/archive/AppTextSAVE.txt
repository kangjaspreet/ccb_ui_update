</ui><br>
<p>No one measure is best--each measure provides a different view or perspective into the impact of the condition. For example, <b>Number of deaths</b> is the simplest, most direct measure, and has clear intuitive meaning, and, other things being equal, will be larger in areas with larger populations.  <b>Crude Death Rate</b> takes the size of the population into account by dividing the number of deaths by the number of people in the population (multiplied by 100,000 for interpretability, i.e. number of deaths per 100,000 people).
<b>Age-adjusted Death Rate</b> is the rate that would have existed if the population had the same age distribution as a reference population. This allows for comparisons between populations with differences in age distributions, accounting for the fact that age itself is generally correlated with higher mortality.
<br><br>
<b>Years of Life Lost</b> sums all the years of life prematurely lost across all people that die from that condition, and is influenced by the age at which people die from the condition and the number of people that die from that condition. <b>Years of Life Lost Rate</b> divides the YLL sum by the number of people in the population, and then multiplies by 100,000 for interpretability. It is the YLL equivalent of the Death Rate. <b>Age-Adjusted YLL rate</b> adjusts for the age structure of the population, and is the YLL equivalent of the Age-Adjusted Death Rate.
<br><br>
<b> Average Age at Death</b> directly measures the mean age of death for a particular condition and/or for a particular geography. Younger average age at death has intrinsic greater impact on a population, and contributes to larger YLL.
<b> Standard Mortality Ratio (SMR)</b> shows the county rate of a condition divided by the rate for the condition in the State overall. This measure will highlight counties that have especially high (or low) rates of a condition compared to the State rate, even if the condition does not have a large number of deaths.

causeHelp <-
'The <b>Cause</b> list contains about 70 conditions, organized based on the hierarchal structure of the Global Burden of Disease Project of the <a href=" https://www.who.int/healthinfo/global_burden_disease/about/en/""> World Health Organization (WHO)</a> and the <a href=" http://www.healthdata.org/gbd/about "">Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME)</a>. We have made modifications to the WHO and IHME lists to enhance the usefulness and applicability for U.S., and specifically California, public health priorities and programs. These modifications are described on the Technical Tab of this website.
<br><br>
Depending on the geographic level selected, different levels of detail in the cause list will be available.  The more granular the geographic level, the less granular the cause list will become, for statistical stability. [For our partners in Local Health Departments and in other California Department of Health Programs, fully granular data on all levels are available on request.]

<br><br>
<b>Top Level</b> conditions are a mutually exclusive and exhaustive set of five high-level conditions indicated by capital letters: A) Communicable, maternal, perinatal, and nutritional conditions; B) Cancer/Malignant neoplasms; C) Cardiovascular diseases; D) Other chronic; E) Injuries; and Z) Unknown/Missing value
<br><br>
<b>Public Health Levels</b> are a mutually exclusive and exhaustive list of about 60 conditions that are subcategories of the Top Level conditions; they are indicated by numbers associated with the capital letter of the Top Level condition under which they are subcategories. This level provides greater clinical detail and public health program specificity. 
<br><br>
<b>Detail Levels</b> are available for a small number of the Public Health Level conditions; these are indicated by a lowercase letter and allow for further specificity.

stateCutHelp <- 
"The <b>State-based cutpoints</b> button changes the way the Measure is broken down or grouped for display in the map and the legend. If the box is checked, the cut-points are based on the data for all 58 counties for the most recent five years.

<br><br>
Looking at the map with the box checked allows you to see how things compare to the State overall. Looking at the data with the box unchecked allows you to see how things compare within the selected county. For example, if most communities in a given county have high rates of something compared to other counties, that county would be almost all red (indicating high rates) with the box checked, and would show a more varied distribution with the box unchecked.

# ---- TAB Help ---------------------------------------------------

mapTab <- paste0("
These maps display the geographic distribution of disease burden among counties and communities across California. The <b>Geo Level</b> options allow the user to change the display from county, to community, to census tract.  This selection is one of the key concepts behind the app, that place matters! Insights into the burden of disease must be explored at multiple geographic levels, especially granular community levels.  Data at the community and the census tract levels are aggregated to 5-year intervals.  
<br><br>
Users can select either the state as a whole or zoom to a specific county for a better view of just that county, and its subcounty detail. 
<br><br>
Users can select from various measures of mortality to assess burden of disease. 
Selecting the <b>State-based cutpoints</b> option allows for comparisons based on the statewide distribution instead of just within the county.
<br><br>
The interactive map allows for zooming in and out to see streets or other geographically identifying locations. 
Also, the interactive map has a pop-up which display information for the geography selected.
<br><br>
The static map is generally better for using in an external presentation (e.g. pasting into a PowerPoint), since it is 'crisper' without the background map layer. The Place Names option displays county and community names.

conditionTab <-
"This tab displays cause-of-death rankings for either a selected county or the whole state.  The figure shows the ranking based on five different measures, and can be sorted based on any of these measures using the <b>Measure Sort Order</b> tool.  Different insights can be gained by ranking on different measures (e.g. ranking on 'YLL per 100,00 population' highlights overall burden; ranking on 'mean age at death' shows the conditions that impact young people the most, and ranking on 'Standard Mortality Ratio (SMR)' show those conditions for which a county has particularly high rates compared to the State average). The <b>Levels to Show</b> option allows users to select between broad or narrow categories of conditions.  The <b>How Many</b> button determines how many causes of death to display on the graph.
<br><br>
Ranking on SMR provides a special window in the potentially unique priority of a condition in the selected geography.  A large SMR means the condition is especially high in that geography relative to the State average, even if the condition does not have a large number of deaths.  This is an important way to detect conditions that, while perhaps not common, are unusually high (or low) in a county or community in which one is interested.  To aid in using this measure, the vertical red line is at 1.2, corresponding to 120% of the State average.  The green line is at 0.8, 80% of the State average and the grey line is at 1.0, right on the State average.
<br><br>
Because the 'base' ratio for the SMR is the state rate, the SMR is not shown when the statewide 'California' geography is selected; it would be 1.0 in all cases.

sdohTab <-

This scatter plot displays the correlation of a selected <b>Social Determinant of Health</b> measure with a selected condition. Each dot maps the value of the social determinant measure against the value of the condition measure for one geographic unit (county, community, or census tract). Because this association is 'ecologic' (correlation of geographic units, not of individuals), it is particularly important in this tab to look at measures that take into account the size and age distribution of the population, such as age-adjusted YLL rate and age-adjusted death rate. While correlations do not indicate causation, they are a potentially important way to understand the differential roles of some social determinants of health on disease outcomes.
<br><br>
In the current version, the colors represent the regions of the state; soon the colors could represent the rurality levels of the county/community/tract or other factors.
<br><br>
In the current version, the size of the dots is proportional to the size of the population represented by the dot.  This too, could represent other things.

'Life Expectancy', or technically 'Life Expectancy at Birth', is calculated based on the number of people in each age group that die in a given year and the total size of each age group population in that same year.

ihmeTab <- paste0('
This (complex) chart shows (with its initial setting) estimates of which <b>factors</b> were associated with the most <b>Disability Adjusted Life Years</b> in California for two different years.  Understanding which factors have the largest impact on health outcomes is essential for effective public health planning.  Decreasing the level of detrimental risk factors (e.g. smoking) and increasing the level of healthy/protective factors (e.g. exercise) is the focus of most public health programs.  
<br><br>
Constructing these estimates requires complicated procedures with many data inputs and many assumptions.   The estimates here are based on sophisticated modeling by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) in Seattle.  IHME generates such estimates for all US States, and for most nations of the world, but not yet for US counties.  Information and resources related to these estimates can be found here.
<br><br>
In the initial setting for this chart, the health outcome being measured is Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALY).  DALY is a powerful measure that sums (1) the number of years a person lives with a condition which decreases their functionality during life (Years Lived with Disability=YLD) and (2) the difference between the age at which they might have lived to without the condition age and the age at which they actually died due to the condition (Years of Life Lost=YLL); DALY = YLD + YLL.   While DALYs is the initial health outcome setting, like almost everything in the chart, it can be changed to a different value which might be more insightful for the particular situation you are exploring.  
The settings for all the modifiable settings (i.e. parameters), with their default values, options, and some explanations are:
